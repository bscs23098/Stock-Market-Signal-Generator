Great choice! This **Stock Market Signal Generator** is a solid, professional-grade project. Here's how we'll break it down into clean steps:

---

### ✅ Phase 1: **Data Collection**

* 📦 **API**: Use `yfinance` (easy and free)
* ✅ Get historical OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
* 🛠️ Store it in a DataFrame for analysis

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

Basic example:

```python
import yfinance as yf

data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2022-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
data.to_csv("aapl_data.csv")
```

---

### ✅ Phase 2: **Indicator Calculations**

* 📊 **Moving Averages** (e.g., 20-day, 50-day)
* 📈 **RSI** (Relative Strength Index)
* 📉 **Bollinger Bands**

I'll provide clean functions for these.

---

### ✅ Phase 3: **Signal Generation**

* If:

  * Price crosses above 20-day MA → *Buy signal*
  * RSI > 70 → *Overbought*
  * RSI < 30 → *Oversold*
  * Price crosses above/below Bollinger Bands → *Buy/Sell*

---

### ✅ Phase 4: **Visualization**

* Use `matplotlib` or `Plotly`
* Annotate signals on a price chart
* Use candlesticks and overlay indicators

---

### ✅ (Optional) Phase 5: **LSTM-Based Prediction**

* Preprocess time-series data
* Use sequences (lookback windows)
* Train an LSTM to predict the next closing price
* Overlay prediction vs actual

---

### ✅ Phase 6: **Packaging & Deployment**

* Create a command-line app or a **Streamlit dashboard**
* Show:

  * Candlestick chart
  * Buy/Sell signals
  * Predictive line
* Optionally deploy via **Streamlit Cloud**
